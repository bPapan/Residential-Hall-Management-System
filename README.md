# Residential-Hall-Management-System

It is a Java project for designing a smart residential hall management system for BUET students.

This software has 3 different modules for three different types of users: central administrator(s), administrator(s) of a hall and students. Using this software, the central administrator(s) can -

1.  Add a new residential hall
2.  Update the capacity/room count of an existing hall 
3.  Assign a hall to each student 
4.  Allow a student to change hall or resident status upon request 
5.  Set fees for the students 
6.  Assign administrators and staff members to the halls.

The administrator(s) of a hall can -

1.  Assign a room to each resident student of the respective hall 
2.  Change the room of a student upon request 
3.  Change payment status for a fee of a student
4.  Organize events in the hall and keep information about the sponsors of those events 
5.  Form teams for different inter-hall events.

A student can - 

1.  Request to change his room within a hall
2.  Request to change the assigned hall or his/her resident status
3.  Observe the pending and paid fees.

Moreover, in this software, each view or page has efficient search facility based on different parameters. 

Before running this software, create tables using Oracle SQL developer or Navicat according to the commands in _Blaze.sql_ file.
